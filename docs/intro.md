# Welcome to the Pwnagotchi community wiki!

The goal of this wiki is to provide as much information as possible to every Pwnagotchi enthusiast - newcomers seeking guidance with building their first Pwnagotchi, as well as the old guard looking for inspiration, or that one line of config you forgot.

If you are new to the project, we recommend you to take a close look at the [Getting Started](/category/getting-started) section of this wiki, where you'll find not only detailed build guides, but also underlying concepts and theory that this project utilizes.

## Community driven effort

Please note, that this wiki is community driven. That means there might be some mistakes. If you spot one, please open an [Issue](https://github.com/Pwnagotchi-Unofficial/pwnagotchi-unofficial.github.io/issues). If you wish to contribute, feel free to do so by checking out the [contribution guide](/contributing)!
